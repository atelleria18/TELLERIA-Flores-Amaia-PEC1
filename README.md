# metaboData
A repository with a few public metabolomics datasets borrowed from different public open sources.

While we don't come out with a better option the repository will be "folder-based". That is
- Each dataset is contained in a folder named with a short-descriptive name with no spaces and no special codes.
- Each folder contains a "description.md" document, written in markdown with information about the dataset.
- Eventually a template will be provided to fuill the description
